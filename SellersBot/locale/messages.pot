"It's challenging for all of us to keep track of all the requests in the groups,\n"

"\n"
"To prevent this, you can upload your inventory in an Excel file,\n"

"you will receive an automatic notification that someone is searching for the stone.\n"
"\n"
"This message will include the stone's parameters and an option to contact the buyer with a simple click,\n"
"so you won't have to track the group daily. The messages will come to you automatically in private.\n"

"Before we begin, click the button below to subscribe. Our service costs $10.99 per month.\n"
